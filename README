Summary
-----------

A simple script to provide rename/mv like functionality for MySQL databases.

This script was written in response to not receiving any desirable answers to a question about easily
switching between two databases in MySQL to minimize downtime when refreshing databases in an actively
used environment.

RENAME DATABASE functionality existed natively within MySQL at one point in time but was removed when
it was found to be unreliable.  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/rename-database.html
